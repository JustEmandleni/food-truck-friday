# Food-Truck-Friday

My first real project in first year at Nelson Mandela University. Contains some of the files I worked on at WERK_. Almost got a lawsuit for using images that were not mine/ images that I had to ask permission to use but nonetheless learnt quite a bit from the experience. It is a project made up of all the initial planning files, graphic designs, marketing footage, social media marketing sprints, UI/ UX designs and a website that I built for them.
